# Cinematic shot templates

Use these for filmic, mood-forward clips. Keep one subject, one action, one camera move.

## Shot grammar (pick one)
- Static wide: locked-off, slow atmosphere changes
- Dolly-in: slow push toward subject
- Dolly-out: reveal more context
- Orbit: 15-45 degree arc around subject
- Lateral move: smooth left-right slide
- Crane: subtle vertical rise
- Handheld drift: gentle, controlled sway
